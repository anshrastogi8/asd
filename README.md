• This repository consists of files required to deploy a ___Web App___ created with ___Flask___ on ___Microsoft___ Azure.
The project helps the user to identify by an indirect way to measure the body fat that doesn't take into account important details about age, sex, bone structure and fat distribution.

Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of body fat based on height and weight. It doesn’t measure body fat directly, but instead uses an equation to make an approximation. BMI can help determine whether a person is at an unhealthy or healthy weight.
Body Mass Index (BMI) is a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters . A high BMI can indicate high body fatness. BMI screens for weight categories that may lead to health problems, but it does not diagnose the body fatness or health of an individual. The project can be extended to include other diseases prediction which I will incorporate later down the road.
